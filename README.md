# Skimer

## About The Project

University project created for our group to keep track of all of our assignments and exams (events). 
We could see the list of all subjects, upcoming events with it's details and progress bar based on finished and unfinished tasks.

It was our first app built with this tech stack and first "bigger" app at all, and we are aware that some things *sometimes* are not working as intended
(ex. Redirecting to login page when user is not logged in, content doesn't load sometimes, wrong chronological order of events), however we are happy with the results ðŸ˜„

## Usage

the application. You can get access to test account in [About The Project](#about-the-project) section
